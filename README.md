## User Story

AS A developer
I WANT a README generator
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

## Installation

I have created a video per requested criteria that is a tutorial for how the install and
run this application. You can find that instructional video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgJEBMRWaO0&feature=youtu.be

In case you do not want to watch the video, here are instructions for installing the application.

First: You click on the green "Code" button on the repository page.

Second: Download the zip file and extract it to a place of your choosing.

Third: Assuming you have Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) installed
Open the file with VS code and inside the Develop folder, right click and "Open in Integrated Termial".
